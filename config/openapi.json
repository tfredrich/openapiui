    "description": "# Agenteux.ai: The AgentOps Platform for AI Agent Ecosystems\n\nAgenteux.ai offers a full suite of APIs to treat AI agents as first-class citizens in your technology stack.\nIts suite of modular services delivers developer tools to improve development productivity, agent reliability and predictability, limit runaway LLM costs and agent abuse, and improve end-to-end visibility across the AI agent development lifecycle.\n\n### Core Components\n\n| Service | Purpose |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| **Agenteux: Schema** | Centralized schema management for `Structured Output Parsing`, data transformation, and inter-agent contracts. Create, version, validate, and publish reusable schemas to standardize communication between agents, APIs, and tools. |\n| **Agenteux: Prompt** | Complete prompt management system. Create, test, and version LLM prompt templates with substitutable variables, A/B testing, analytics, and rollback capabilities. |\n| **Agenteux: Security** | Purpose-built API security and control. Enable authentication, rate limiting, usage-based billing, and compliance for agent-driven traffic. |\n| **Agenteux: Toggle** | Dynamic runtime control. Manage feature flags, rollouts, experiments, and kill switches for agents without redeployment. |\n| **Agenteux: Domain** | Full white-label and custom domain management for branded agent experiences. Support for SSL, DNS, and multi-tenant branding. |\n| **Agenteux: Link** | Smart link management for agent communications. Generate branded, trackable, and workflow-aware URLs with analytics and automation. |\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Unified AgentOps Experience\n\nAll Agenteux services are fully **API-first** and designed for interoperability:\n\n- Centralized dashboard for cross-service visibility  \n- Unified team management and access control  \n- Consistent JSON-based policy model across components  \n- Real-time monitoring and analytics  \n- SDKs for Python, JavaScript, Java, and Go  \n\nThe platform seamlessly integrates into modern AI architectures, whether you’re building autonomous agents, LLM-based assistants, or complex multi-agent workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 🏢 Built for Enterprise Scale\n\nAgenteux.ai delivers production-grade features out of the box:\n\n- **Security & Compliance:** Multi-tenant access controls, audit logging, and data residency options  \n- **Reliability:** 99.99% uptime SLA and global availability zones  \n- **Private Cloud:** Deploy on-premises or in dedicated environments  \n- **Integration:** Native support for OAuth, SSO, and CI/CD pipelines  \n- **Observability:** Comprehensive telemetry and event streaming  \n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Why Agenteux.ai\n\n- **Accelerate Deployment:** Move from prototype to production much faster, treating prompts, schemas, security as code\n- **Reduce Complexity:** Replace ad-hoc tooling with a unified stack with simpler workflows\n- **Control Costs:** Enforce rate limits, track usage, and optimize API and LLM spend\n- **Increase Reliability:** Ensure consistent agent behavior and schema compatibility\n- **Enable Innovation:** Focus on agent design instead of infrastructure management\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Learn More\n\n- **Website:** [https://www.agenteux.ai](https://www.agenteux.ai)  \n- **Docs:** [https://docs.agenteux.ai](https://docs.agenteux.ai)  \n- **Demo:** [https://www.agenteux.ai/demo](https://www.agenteux.ai/demo)  \n- **Support:** [support@agenteux.ai](mailto:support@agenteux.ai)\n\n---\n\n*Agenteux.ai — Where AI Agents Meet Enterprise Infrastructure.*"

Quota applies SLAs or license limits to API consumers.\n- Throttle is a rolling window of budgeted usage for traffic-shaping over a shorter time period of hours, minutes, or seconds.\n"
